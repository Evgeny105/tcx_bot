# Telegram Bot for Uploading TCX Files from Kinomap to Garmin Connect

This Telegram bot automates the process of converting and uploading TCX files from Kinomap to Garmin Connect. Users can easily send their workout data through the bot, simplifying integration with the Garmin ecosystem.

---

## Features

- **Easy Authorization**: During the first use, the bot requests your Garmin Connect login and password. These credentials are used to obtain an access token, which is securely stored for future sessions.
- **Flexible File Support**: The bot accepts:
  - Single TCX files.
  - ZIP archives containing multiple TCX files.
- **Automated Conversion and Upload**: After receiving files, the bot:
  1. Converts them to the required format.
  2. Uploads them to your Garmin Connect account.
  If a workout already exists in Garmin Connect, the bot notifies you and returns the converted TCX files.
- **User Commands**:
  - `/start`: Start the bot and check its status.
  - `/stop`: Remove stored authorization data.
